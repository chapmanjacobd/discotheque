   * Native Browser PiP: Add support for the Picture-in-Picture API              (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_AP
     I) for video, allowing users to watch content while switching tabs or
     minimizing the browser.
   * Audio Visualizer: For audio playback, add a Canvas-based frequency          visualizer. Since you're already using the <audio> tag, this can be         done via the Web Audio API.                                               * Waveform Seekbar: Replace the standard browser seekbar with a generated     waveform for audio files (using something like wavesurfer.js).
